        possible to share functions, forms,single panels, logical data view to 
        perform database access and specific java methods, with all applications.<br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        The execution and the <strong><em>application behaviour</em></strong> 
        can by strongly configurated at runtime by user login, form, data access, 
        variables content, with further reduction of new applications need.<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore forward applications are naturally internationalizated and 
        all texts can be set by language.<br>
        The software development cycle is incremental and there is no difference 
        between the prototype and the final application, because they are using 
        the same models and infrastructure.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Forward</em> implements an elementary data item driven approach, to 
        say that elementary data, with name and type, pilots the application.<br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>Only functional focus is required and technical details are 
        unnecessary.</strong></em><br>
        <br>
        With <em>Forward</em> you are allowed to realize applications without 
        to escape from the analysis domain.<br>
        Of course the application running is java and so, if it needs, all java 
        features are available. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>All <em>Amrita</em> modules are realized by <em>Forward</em></strong>.<br>

    <td width="296" rowspan="2" bgcolor="#DFDFDF"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
      <em>Forward</em> module symbolyzes the bridge bridge between old legacy 
      Cobol applications managed by Amrita modules and modern, new java applications.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Forward</em> is what that today is called an <strong>MDD</strong> (<em>Model 
      Driven Development</em>) to realize applications by patterns against hard 
      manual expensive code towards a declarative model approach. <br>
      <br>
      <em>Forward</em> is based on a general and straightforward application model, 
      where are depicted in a way effective, exaustive and powerful all application 
      key points: user interface, execution flow, data access and application 
      logic.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Forward</em> is written in <strong>java</strong> and produces java code. 
      Main aspects to be underlined are the development time and maintenability 
      dramatically reduced, and a reusability at the model and single application 
      logic level. <br>
      <br>
      <em><strong>Reusability</strong></em> is a really key point in Forward applications.
