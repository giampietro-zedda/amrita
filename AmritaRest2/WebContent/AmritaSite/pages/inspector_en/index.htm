        with programs called and caller with related shared data, with contextual 
        analysis of execution paths, and data modified.<br>
        <br>
        Inspector doesn't work with original sources but with the java object 
        descriptor generated by means of the <em><a href="../assasment_en/index.htm">Assesment</a></em> 
        process and the Amrita database populated by the Assesment process.<br>
        <br>
        This means that all of informations are already available in a structured 
        form, designed for maintenance purposes too.</font> </div>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
        about generalized dynamic instructions, solved by initial source analysis 
        or by subsequent <em><a href="../assasment_en/index.htm">Assesment</a></em> 
        processes, all possible dynamic values, detected by static analysis, are 
        shown for each dynamic instruction.<br>
        <br>
        For example, besides a &quot;call <em>nome-pgm</em>&quot; instruction, 
        are listed all values that the field <em>nome-pgm</em> could have runtime, 
        to say all programs potentially called by means of the dynamic instruction.<br>
        <br>
        The dynamic instruction code solved by Amrita specialized analyzers, remarkable 
        from the <em><a href="../assasment_en/index.htm">Assesment</a></em> and 
        quality control point of view, is essential in this maintenance phase, 
        to avoid a not desiderable regression test fault.</font></p>
